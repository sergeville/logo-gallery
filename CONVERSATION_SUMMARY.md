# Conversation Summary: Build Issues Resolution

## Initial Setup and Dependencies
- The user is working on a project located at `/Users/sergevilleneuve/Desktop/logo-gallery`
- Successfully installed project dependencies with npm
- Added necessary configurations in `tsconfig.test.json` and `package.json`

## Visual Test Files
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `visual-test-utils.ts`
- Updated test files to match the `TestState` interface
- Removed unused imports like `LOCALHOST_URL` from test setup files
- Fixed responsive test files to properly use `VIEWPORT_SIZES`

## Test Reliability and Jest Setup
- Attempted multiple approaches to fix parsing errors in `test-reliability.ts`
- Restructured the `setupReliabilityTest` function to properly handle error boundaries
- Removed unused types and variables from `jest.setup.ts`
- Fixed Function type issues in mock implementations
- Improved type safety in mock React hooks

## Current Status
- Still working on resolving remaining ESLint errors:
  - Parsing error in `test-reliability.ts`
  - Unexpected any types in error handling files
  - Require style imports in script files
  - Array and case statement issues in user model
  - Function type safety warnings in Jest setup

## Next Steps
- Continue working on resolving the remaining ESLint errors
- Focus on fixing the parsing error in `test-reliability.ts`
- Address type safety issues in error handling files
- Convert require style imports to ES modules
- Fix array and case statement issues in the user model

## Initial Issues
Two main build issues were encountered:

1. ESLint Configuration Error:
   - Error message: `Unknown options: useEslintrc, extensions - 'extensions' has been removed`
   - Multiple attempts were made to fix the ESLint configuration
   - Final solution involved simplifying the `.eslintrc.js` configuration

2. TypeScript Route Handler Type Error:
   - Error in `app/api/images/[...path]/route.ts`
   - Error message: `Type "{ params: { path: string[]; }; }" is not a valid type for the function's second argument`
   - Multiple approaches were tried to fix the route handler types

## Attempted Solutions

### ESLint Configuration
1. Removed ESLint configuration from `next.config.js`
2. Simplified `.eslintrc.js` by:
   - Removing unnecessary settings
   - Keeping only essential rules and configurations
   - Adding appropriate ignore patterns

### Route Handler Types
Multiple approaches were attempted to fix the route handler types:

1. Using inline type:
   ```typescript
   { params }: { params: { path: string[] } }
   ```

2. Using interface:
   ```typescript
   interface RouteSegment {
     params: {
       path: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

3. Using type alias:
   ```typescript
   type Params = { params: { path: string[] } };
   ```

4. Using context parameter:
   ```typescript
   context: { params: { path: string[] } }
   ```

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/images/[...path]/route.ts`
2. `.eslintrc.js`
3. `next.config.js`

## Related Files
Several route files were examined for reference:
- `app/api/logos/route.ts`
- `app/api/logos/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/user/profile/route.ts`
- And others with similar route handler implementations
