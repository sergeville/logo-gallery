# Conversation Summary: Build Issues Resolution

## Initial Issues
Two main build issues were encountered:

1. ESLint Configuration Error:
   - Error message: `Unknown options: useEslintrc, extensions - 'extensions' has been removed`
   - Multiple attempts were made to fix the ESLint configuration
   - Final solution involved simplifying the `.eslintrc.js` configuration

2. TypeScript Route Handler Type Error:
   - Error in `app/api/images/[...path]/route.ts`
   - Error message: `Type "{ params: { path: string[]; }; }" is not a valid type for the function's second argument`
   - Multiple approaches were tried to fix the route handler types

## Attempted Solutions

### ESLint Configuration
1. Removed ESLint configuration from `next.config.js`
2. Simplified `.eslintrc.js` by:
   - Removing unnecessary settings
   - Keeping only essential rules and configurations
   - Adding appropriate ignore patterns

### Route Handler Types
Multiple approaches were attempted to fix the route handler types:

1. Using inline type:
   ```typescript
   { params }: { params: { path: string[] } }
   ```

2. Using interface:
   ```typescript
   interface RouteSegment {
     params: {
       path: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

3. Using type alias:
   ```typescript
   type Params = { params: { path: string[] } };
   ```

4. Using context parameter:
   ```typescript
   context: { params: { path: string[] } }
   ```

## Current Status
- ESLint configuration has been simplified but the error persists
- Route handler type issue remains unresolved
- Build process continues to fail with the same errors

## Next Steps
1. Further investigation needed for:
   - The source of the ESLint configuration error
   - The correct Next.js App Router route handler types
2. Consider:
   - Checking Next.js documentation for correct route handler types
   - Investigating if there are hidden ESLint configurations
   - Reviewing other successful route implementations in the codebase

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/images/[...path]/route.ts`
2. `.eslintrc.js`
3. `next.config.js`

## Related Files
Several route files were examined for reference:
- `app/api/logos/route.ts`
- `app/api/logos/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/user/profile/route.ts`
- And others with similar route handler implementations
