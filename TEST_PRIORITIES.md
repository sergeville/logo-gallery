# Test Priorities for Logo Gallery

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Critical functionality that must work for basic application operation
- **P1**: Important features that significantly impact user experience
- **P2**: Nice-to-have features and edge cases
- **P3**: Optional features and rare edge cases

## Logo Upload Tests

### P0 - Critical Tests
- [x] Valid file upload (PNG/JPEG/SVG)
  - Verifies basic upload functionality
  - Checks file metadata storage
  - Confirms database persistence
- [x] File size validation
  - Rejects files over 2MB limit
  - Returns appropriate error message
- [x] File type validation
  - Accepts only PNG, JPEG, and SVG formats
  - Rejects invalid file types with error message

### P1 - Important Tests
- [x] Image metadata validation
  - Verify width and height are stored correctly
  - Validate metadata format
  - Reject invalid dimensions
  - Handle missing metadata
- [x] User association
  - Ensure logos are correctly linked to users
  - Verify user permissions for upload
  - Reject invalid user IDs
  - Handle non-existent users

### P2 - Nice-to-have Tests
- [ ] Duplicate file handling
  - Check behavior when same file is uploaded multiple times
  - Verify version control if implemented
- [ ] File name sanitization
  - Test special characters in file names
  - Verify unique file name generation

### P3 - Optional Tests
- [ ] Performance testing
  - Multiple simultaneous uploads
  - Large batch uploads
- [ ] Edge cases
  - Zero byte files
  - Maximum file name length
  - Special characters in metadata

## Database Operations Tests

### P0 - Critical Tests
- [x] Basic CRUD operations
  - Create new logo entries
  - Read logo data
  - Update logo metadata
  - Delete logos
- [x] Data integrity
  - Verify stored data matches uploaded data
  - Check all required fields are present

### P1 - Important Tests
- [ ] Query performance
  - Test index effectiveness
  - Verify query response times
- [ ] Concurrent operations
  - Test multiple simultaneous operations
  - Verify data consistency

## Test Implementation Notes

### Current Coverage
- Basic file validation (size, type)
- Database operations (insert, retrieve)
- User association
- Metadata storage

### Areas for Improvement
1. Add more edge case testing
2. Implement concurrent operation tests
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Expand metadata validation

### Test Helper Utilities
- `mockFileUpload`: Creates mock file objects for testing
- `createTestUser`: Sets up test user accounts
- `createTestLogo`: Creates test logo entries
- Database cleanup between tests

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test runs in isolation with fresh database state
2. **Mocking**: File operations are mocked for consistency
3. **Cleanup**: Database is cleared between tests
4. **Async Handling**: Proper async/await usage for database operations
5. **Error Cases**: Explicit testing of error conditions

## Future Enhancements

1. Add stress testing for upload functionality
2. Implement integration tests with front-end
3. Add performance benchmarking suite
4. Expand test coverage for edge cases
5. Add API endpoint testing
