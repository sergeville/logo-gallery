## Security Architecture

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application implements a comprehensive RBAC system with the following components:

1. **Role Configuration**
   - Centralized role and permission definitions
   - Hierarchical permission structure
   - Flexible permission management

2. **Authentication Integration**
   - JWT-based role storage
   - Session-based role access
   - OAuth provider role assignment

3. **Access Control**
   - Middleware-based API protection
   - Component-level UI protection
   - Granular permission checking

4. **Implementation Layers**
   - Database: Role storage in User model
   - API: Permission middleware
   - Frontend: RBAC hooks and components
   - OAuth: Automatic role assignment
