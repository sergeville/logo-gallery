# Current Test Failures

## Visual Tests

### Critical Issues
1. Animation Detection
   - **File**: `e2e/visual-tests/utils/visual-test-utils.ts`
   - **Issue**: MutationObserver may not catch all animation completions
   - **Status**: Under Investigation
   - **Workaround**: Added 2s timeout fallback

2. Responsive Layout Tests
   - **File**: `e2e/visual-tests/layout.visual.spec.ts`
   - **Issue**: Intermittent failures on viewport transitions
   - **Status**: In Progress
   - **Workaround**: Added additional wait time between viewport changes

### Non-Critical Issues
1. Image Loading
   - **File**: `e2e/visual-tests/logo-gallery.percy.spec.ts`
   - **Issue**: Occasional timeout on large image galleries
   - **Status**: Known Issue
   - **Workaround**: Increased timeout values

2. Cache State Tests
   - **File**: `e2e/visual-tests/middleware/middleware.visual.spec.ts`
   - **Issue**: Flaky tests due to race conditions
   - **Status**: To Be Fixed
   - **Workaround**: Added retry logic

## Recent Failures (Last 7 Days)

### February 1, 2024
- ❌ Animation completion test failed on CI
- ✅ Fixed: Responsive layout test failures
- ⚠️ Investigating: Cache state inconsistencies

### January 31, 2024
- ❌ Image loading timeout on large galleries
- ✅ Fixed: Authentication state test failures
- ⚠️ Investigating: Dark mode transition issues

## Action Items
1. High Priority
   - [ ] Implement robust animation completion detection
   - [ ] Fix responsive layout test flakiness
   - [ ] Optimize image loading performance

2. Medium Priority
   - [ ] Refactor cache state tests
   - [ ] Add retry mechanism for flaky tests
   - [ ] Improve error reporting

3. Low Priority
   - [ ] Document known workarounds
   - [ ] Create test failure patterns guide
   - [ ] Update test timeout configurations

## Resolution Progress
- [x] Implemented initial animation detection fix
- [x] Added detailed logging for viewport changes
- [ ] Investigating cache state race conditions
- [ ] Optimizing image loading strategy

## Notes
- Most failures occur in CI environment
- Local test runs are more stable
- Consider implementing parallel test execution
- Need to improve test isolation
