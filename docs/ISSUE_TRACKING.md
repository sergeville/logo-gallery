# Issue Tracking and Resolution Guide

## Database Connection Issues in Tests

### Issue #1: Database Connection Failures in Profile Operations Tests
**Description:**  
Tests were failing with database connection errors, particularly when trying to verify connection status.

**Symptoms:**
- Tests failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isConnected')"
- Inconsistent connection state between tests
- Connection cache not being properly cleared

**Attempted Solutions:**

1. Using `serverConfig.isConnected()`:
```typescript
if (!testDb || !testDb.serverConfig.isConnected()) {
  const { db } = await connectToDatabase();
  testDb = db;
}
```
Result: Failed - `serverConfig` was undefined in some cases

2. Using direct connection check:
```typescript
try {
  await testDb.command({ ping: 1 });
} catch (error) {
  const { db } = await connectToDatabase();
  testDb = db;
}
```
Result: More reliable but still had edge cases

3. Final Working Solution:
```typescript
beforeEach(async () => {
  try {
    // Always get a fresh connection for each test
    const { db } = await connectToDatabase();
    testDb = db;

    // Clean up database collections
    await testDb.collection('users').deleteMany({});
    
    // Rest of the setup...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Test setup failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
});
```

**Best Practices for Database Connection Management:**
1. Always clear connection cache before establishing new connections
2. Use try-catch blocks for all database operations
3. Implement proper cleanup in afterAll/afterEach hooks
4. Verify connection status with actual database operations
5. Log connection state changes for debugging

### Issue #2: Connection Cache Not Being Cleared

**Description:**  
Cached database connections weren't being properly cleared between tests, leading to stale connections.

**Symptoms:**
- Tests passing individually but failing when run together
- Intermittent "Connection already closed" errors
- Memory leaks in long test runs

**Solution:**
1. Implemented proper connection cleanup:
```typescript
afterAll(async () => {
  try {
    await closeDatabase();
    await mongoServer.stop();
    process.env.MONGODB_URI = ''; // Clear the URI
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to cleanup test environment:', error);
    throw error;
  }
});
```

2. Added connection state verification:
```typescript
beforeAll(async () => {
  // Set up MongoDB URI and ensure cached connection is cleared
  await closeDatabase();
  process.env.MONGODB_URI = mongoServer.getUri();
  
  // Rest of setup...
});
```

**Best Practices for Connection Cache Management:**
1. Always clear connection cache in beforeAll
2. Reset environment variables after tests
3. Implement proper error handling for cleanup
4. Log cleanup operations for debugging
5. Use in-memory database for tests when possible

### Issue #3: Logo Management in Collections Test Failures

**Description:**  
Tests for adding and removing logos from collections were failing due to undefined `_id` property in the test logo object.

**Symptoms:**
- TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_id')
- Logo management operations failing in collection tests
- Test setup not properly initializing test logo data

**Solution:**
1. Fixed the `uploadLogo` function call in test setup:
```typescript
const result = await uploadLogo({
  userId: testUserId,
  title: 'Test Logo',
  description: 'A logo for testing collections',
  tags: ['test'],
  file: {
    name: 'test-logo.png',
    type: 'image/png',
    size: 1024,
    buffer: Buffer.from('mock-logo-data')
  }
});
testLogo = result.logo;
```

**Best Practices for Test Data Setup:**
1. Ensure test data is properly initialized before running tests
2. Validate test data structure matches expected interface
3. Use proper type definitions for test data
4. Include all required fields in test data setup
5. Verify test data is accessible throughout the test suite

### Issue #4: Logo Management in Collections - Logo ID Reference Failures

**Description:**  
Two tests in the Logo Management in Collections suite failed due to undefined `_id` property when trying to add and remove logos from collections.

**Symptoms:**
- TypeError in `should add a logo to a collection`: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_id')
- TypeError in `should remove a logo from a collection`: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_id')
- Test failures occurring at lines 152 and 173 in collection-operations.test.ts

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. The `testLogo` object is not being properly initialized in the test setup
2. The `uploadLogo` function may not be returning the expected logo structure
3. Potential type mismatch between expected and actual logo object structure

4. Log detailed object state for debugging
5. Consider using factory functions for test data creation

### Issue #5: Logo Upload Duplicate and Similar File Detection Failures

**Description:**  
Three tests in the Logo Upload suite are failing, all related to duplicate and similar file detection functionality.

**Symptoms:**
1. `detects exact duplicate file upload by hash` failing:
   - Expected `isValid` to be true for first upload
   - Test failing at line 514 in logo-upload.test.ts
2. `detects similar images even with different filenames` failing:
   - Expected `isValid` to be true for first upload
   - Test failing at line 543 in logo-upload.test.ts
3. `allows different images to be uploaded` failing:
   - Expected `isValid` to be true for first upload
   - Test failing at line 572 in logo-upload.test.ts

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. File hash comparison may not be working correctly
2. Similar image detection algorithm might be too strict or not functioning
3. Image validation logic might be rejecting valid uploads

**Impact:**
- Duplicate file detection not working as expected
- Similar image detection failing
- Valid unique images being incorrectly rejected

**Resolution:**
✅ Issue resolved by:
1. Separated duplicate checking into its own function for better organization
2. Added proper race condition handling using `findOneAndUpdate` with `upsert`
3. Improved error messages to be more specific about the type of duplicate
4. Fixed similar image detection to only check against the user's own logos
5. Added better similarity information in the response

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Check for duplicates and similar images
const duplicateCheck = await checkForDuplicates(db, {
  fileHash,
  imageFeatures,
  userId,
  allowSystemDuplicates,
  allowSimilarImages
});

if (!duplicateCheck.isValid) {
  return duplicateCheck;
}

// Use findOneAndUpdate to handle race conditions
const result = await db.collection('logos').findOneAndUpdate(
  {
    fileHash,
    userId: new ObjectId(userId)
  },
  {
    $setOnInsert: logo
  },
  {
    upsert: true,
    returnDocument: 'after'
  }
);
```

**Best Practices Learned:**
1. Use atomic operations for race condition handling
2. Separate complex validation logic into dedicated functions

3. Add metrics for duplicate detection success/failure rates
4. Consider implementing batch upload validation
5. Add automated cleanup for rejected uploads

### Issue #6: PNG File Validation and Mock File Generation Issues

**Description:**  
Logo upload tests were failing due to invalid PNG file structure in mock files and incorrect CRC checksum validation.

**Symptoms:**
1. `handles valid PNG file` failing:
   - Error: "Input buffer has corrupt header: pngload_buffer: invalid chunk checksum"
   - Test failing at line 150 in logo-upload.test.ts
2. Multiple other tests failing with similar checksum errors
3. Sharp library rejecting mock PNG files

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Mock PNG files had incorrect CRC checksums for IHDR, IDAT, and IEND chunks
2. PNG color type was set incorrectly (RGB instead of RGBA)
3. CRC values were hardcoded instead of being calculated dynamically

**Impact:**
- All PNG file upload tests failing
- Image feature extraction not working
- Duplicate detection tests failing as a result

**Resolution:**
✅ Issue resolved by:
1. Added proper CRC32 calculation function following PNG specification
2. Changed color type from RGB (0x02) to RGBA (0x06) to match test requirements
3. Now calculating CRC values dynamically for each chunk (IHDR, IDAT, IEND)
4. Using `writeInt32BE` instead of `writeUInt32BE` for CRC values since they can be negative

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Calculate IHDR CRC
const ihdrCrcData = Buffer.concat([ihdrChunkType, ihdrChunkData]);
const ihdrCrc = this.calculateCrc32(ihdrCrcData);
const ihdrChunkCrc = Buffer.alloc(4);
ihdrChunkCrc.writeInt32BE(ihdrCrc);

// Calculate IDAT CRC
const idatCrcData = Buffer.concat([idatChunkType, idatData]);
const idatCrc = this.calculateCrc32(idatCrcData);
const idatChunkCrc = Buffer.alloc(4);
idatChunkCrc.writeInt32BE(idatCrc);

// Calculate IEND CRC
const iendCrc = this.calculateCrc32(iendChunkType);
const iendChunkCrc = Buffer.alloc(4);
iendChunkCrc.writeInt32BE(iendCrc);
```

**Best Practices for Mock File Generation:**
1. Follow file format specifications strictly when creating mock files
2. Calculate checksums and other validation data dynamically
3. Validate mock files with the actual libraries that will process them
4. Add proper error handling and logging for mock file generation
5. Consider using real file samples as templates for mock data

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Don't use hardcoded checksums or validation data
2. Test mock files with actual processing libraries before using in tests
3. Follow file format specifications precisely
4. Add proper error logging to catch validation issues early
5. Consider file format requirements (like color type) when creating mocks

1. Implemented proper perceptual hashing using DCT-based algorithm
2. Added robust average hash calculation using grayscale image data
3. Implemented proper dominant color extraction
4. Improved image comparison using multiple similarity metrics
5. Added proper error handling and logging

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Generate average hash using proper image processing
const averageHash = await calculateAverageHash(image);

// Generate perceptual hash using DCT-based algorithm
const perceptualHash = await calculatePerceptualHash(image);

// Extract dominant colors using proper color quantization
const dominantColors = await extractDominantColors(image);

// Return comprehensive image features
return {
  width,
  height,
  aspectRatio,
  averageHash,
  perceptualHash,
  dominantColors: dominantColors.map(color => 
    `#${color.r.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')}${color.g.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')}${color.b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')}`

   - "This logo has already been uploaded by another user" for system-wide duplicates
   - "Similar logo already exists in your collection" for similar images
2. Fixed validation logic to properly distinguish between:
   - Exact duplicates from the same user
   - System-wide duplicates from other users
   - Similar images in user's collection
3. Ensured consistent error messages across all validation paths:
   - Database queries
   - Duplicate checks
   - Similar image detection

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Check for exact duplicates
if (exactDuplicate) {
  return {
    isValid: false,
    status: 409,
    error: 'You have already uploaded this logo'
  };
}

// Check for system-wide duplicates
if (systemDuplicate) {
  return {
    isValid: false,
    status: 409,
    error: 'This logo has already been uploaded by another user'
  };
}

// Check for similar images
if (similarity.similarity > SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD) {
  return {
    isValid: false,
    status: 409,
    error: 'Similar logo already exists in your collection',
    similarityInfo: {
      similarity: similarity.similarity,
      matchType: similarity.matchType
    }
  };
}
```

#### Best Practices
1. Use consistent error messages across the application

### Issue #12: Image Similarity Detection and Validation

**Description:**  
Tests for similar image detection were failing due to overly strict similarity thresholds and inconsistent test data generation.

**Symptoms:**
1. Test "detects similar images even with different filenames" failing:
   - Expected similar images to be rejected but they were being allowed
2. Test "allows different images to be uploaded" failing:
   - Expected different images to be allowed but they were being rejected as similar
3. Inconsistent behavior in image similarity detection

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Similarity thresholds in `determineMatchType` function were too strict
2. Test helper was generating identical PNG files for all test cases
3. Image feature extraction not properly distinguishing between similar and different images

**Impact:**
- False positives in similar image detection
- False negatives in different image detection
- Inconsistent user experience when uploading similar/different images

**Resolution:**
✅ Issue resolved by:
1. Adjusted similarity thresholds in `determineMatchType`:
   ```typescript
   function determineMatchType(similarity: number): string {
     if (similarity > 0.95) return 'exact';
     if (similarity > 0.80) return 'very similar';
     if (similarity > 0.65) return 'similar';
     if (similarity > 0.50) return 'somewhat similar';
     return 'different';
   }
   ```
2. Updated test helper to generate different pixel data based on filename:
   ```typescript
   let pixelData: Buffer;
   if (filename.includes('similar')) {
     // For similar images, use a slightly off-white pixel
     pixelData = Buffer.from([0xFF, 0xFE, 0xFE, 0xFF]); // Very slightly pink
   } else if (filename.includes('different')) {
     // For different images, use a blue pixel
     pixelData = Buffer.from([0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF]); // Blue
   } else {
     // Default to white pixel
     pixelData = Buffer.from([0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF]); // White
   }
   ```
3. Improved PNG file generation with proper CRC checksums and chunk structure

**Best Practices for Image Processing:**
1. Use appropriate thresholds for image similarity detection
2. Generate test data that properly represents different test cases
3. Validate image processing results with real-world examples
4. Consider multiple similarity metrics (hash, color, aspect ratio)
5. Implement proper error handling for image processing failures

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Test data should accurately represent different test scenarios
2. Image similarity thresholds need careful calibration
3. PNG file generation must follow proper file format specifications
4. Multiple similarity metrics provide more accurate results
5. Error handling should be comprehensive and informative

### Issue #13: Image Similarity Detection Thresholds and Test Data Generation

**Description:**  
Image similarity detection tests were failing due to mismatched thresholds between validation and similarity detection, as well as issues with test data generation.

**Symptoms:**
1. Test "detects similar images even with different filenames" failing:
   - Expected similar images to be rejected but they were being allowed
   - Test failing at line 559 in logo-upload.test.ts
2. Test "allows different images to be uploaded" failing:
   - Expected different images to be allowed but they were being rejected as similar
   - Test failing at line 596 in logo-upload.test.ts

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Threshold mismatch:
   - `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` in logo-validation.ts was set to 0.65
   - Thresholds in image-similarity.ts had different values
2. Test data generation:
   - Mock PNG files weren't different enough for proper testing
   - Color differences weren't significant enough

**Impact:**
- False positives in similar image detection
- False negatives in different image detection
- Inconsistent behavior in image upload validation

**Resolution:**
✅ Issue resolved by:
1. Aligned thresholds between modules:
   ```typescript
   // In logo-validation.ts
   const SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.70; // Match the 'similar' threshold from image-similarity.ts

   // In image-similarity.ts
   function determineMatchType(similarity: number): string {
     if (similarity > 0.98) return 'exact';
     if (similarity > 0.85) return 'very similar';
     if (similarity > 0.70) return 'similar';
     if (similarity > 0.55) return 'somewhat similar';
     return 'different';
   }
   ```

2. Improved test data generation:
   ```typescript
   let pixelData: Buffer;
   if (fileData.name.includes('similar')) {
     // Similar image: slightly different white pixel
     pixelData = Buffer.from([0xFE, 0xFE, 0xFE, 0xFF]); // Very slightly off-white
   } else if (fileData.name.includes('different')) {
     // Different image: red pixel (completely different from white)
     pixelData = Buffer.from([0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF]); // Pure red
   } else {
     // Default: white pixel
     pixelData = Buffer.from([0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF]); // White
   }
   ```

**Best Practices:**
1. Keep thresholds consistent across related modules
2. Use significantly different test data for different test cases
3. Document threshold values and their significance
4. Consider color space and perception in image comparison
5. Test with edge cases (very similar and very different images)

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Coordinate threshold values between modules
2. Make test data clearly represent different cases
3. Consider human perception in similarity detection
4. Document threshold decisions
5. Test with diverse image data

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor similarity detection accuracy in production
2. Consider adding more test cases with varied images
3. Add performance monitoring for image processing
4. Consider implementing batch image processing
5. Add automated cleanup for rejected uploads
