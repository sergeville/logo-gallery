## Duplicate File Handling

### Overview
The logo gallery implements robust duplicate file detection to prevent redundant uploads and maintain data integrity. The system uses SHA-256 hashing to identify duplicate files, regardless of filename or metadata differences.

### Features
- Per-user duplicate detection
- System-wide duplicate detection (optional)
- Content-based detection (using file hashes)
- Support for reupload after deletion
- Concurrent upload handling

### Implementation Details

#### File Hash Generation
- Uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm
- Hash is generated from file content (buffer)
- Stored with each logo record for efficient lookups

#### Duplicate Detection Process
1. File hash is generated upon upload
2. System checks for existing files with the same hash
3. Two levels of duplicate checking:
   - User-level: Prevents same user from uploading duplicate files
   - System-level: Optional check for duplicates across all users

#### Configuration Options
- `allowSystemDuplicates`: Controls whether to allow the same file to be uploaded by different users
- Default behavior prevents duplicates per user but allows cross-user duplicates

### Error Handling
- Status code 409 (Conflict) for duplicate files
- Different error messages for:
  - User-owned duplicates: "Duplicate file detected"
  - System-wide duplicates: "File already exists in the system"

### Test Coverage
The duplicate handling functionality is thoroughly tested with cases for:
- Basic duplicate detection
- Cross-user uploads
- Filename variations
- Metadata differences
- Post-deletion reuploads
- Concurrent uploads

### Best Practices
1. Always check for duplicates before processing uploads
2. Use content-based detection rather than filename matching
3. Consider storage implications when allowing cross-user duplicates
4. Implement proper cleanup for deleted files
5. Handle concurrent uploads gracefully

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add similarity detection for near-duplicate images
- [ ] Implement duplicate file management UI
- [ ] Add batch duplicate checking
- [ ] Support for duplicate file versioning
