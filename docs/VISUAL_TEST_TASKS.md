# Visual Test Tasks

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up basic visual testing infrastructure with Playwright
- [x] Implement responsive layout testing across multiple viewports
- [x] Create utility functions for visual test preparation
- [x] Add loading state tests for components
- [x] Implement error state testing
- [x] Add accessibility testing integration with axe-core
- [x] Create middleware visual tests
- [x] Implement logo gallery visual tests
- [x] Add authentication state testing
- [x] Implement caching behavior tests

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Add visual regression testing for dark mode
- [ ] Implement visual tests for user interactions (hover, click states)
- [ ] Add animation testing coverage
- [ ] Create visual tests for form validation states
- [ ] Implement visual tests for notification components

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Add performance monitoring to visual tests
- [ ] Implement cross-browser visual testing
- [ ] Create visual tests for internationalization (RTL layouts)
- [ ] Add visual tests for custom themes
- [ ] Implement visual tests for print layouts

## Testing Standards
1. All new components must have visual tests for:
   - Initial render state
   - Loading state
   - Error state
   - Empty state (if applicable)
   - Responsive layouts
   - Accessibility compliance

2. Visual Test Requirements:
   - Must use data-testid attributes for element selection
   - Must handle all viewport sizes defined in VIEWPORT_SIZES
   - Must include accessibility checks
   - Must verify proper image loading
   - Must account for animations and transitions

3. Performance Requirements:
   - Visual tests should complete within 5 minutes
   - Tests should be optimized for CI/CD pipeline
   - Resource-intensive tests should be marked appropriately

## Best Practices
1. Use the preparePageForVisualTest utility for consistent test setup
2. Implement proper waiting strategies for dynamic content
3. Mock API responses for consistent test states
4. Use meaningful screenshot names
5. Group related tests in describe blocks
6. Add proper error messages and assertions
7. Document test coverage gaps

## Known Issues
- Animation completion detection needs improvement
- Intermittent failures in responsive tests
- Performance issues with large image galleries
- Inconsistent behavior across different browsers
