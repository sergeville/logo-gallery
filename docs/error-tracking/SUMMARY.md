# Test Failure Analysis and Task Summary

## Overview

**Test Suite**: `design-documentation.visual.spec.ts`
**Date**: January 31, 2024
**Total Errors**: 50
**Total Tasks**: 9

## Error Distribution

### By Priority
- Critical: 3 (33.3%)
- High: 2 (22.2%)
- Medium: 2 (22.2%)
- Low: 2 (22.2%)

### By Browser
All issues are reproducible across all tested browsers:
- Chromium
- Firefox
- WebKit
- Mobile Chrome
- Mobile Safari

### By Error Type
- TimeoutError: 9 (100%)
  - All errors related to component mounting and rendering timing

## Critical Issues

1. **Homepage Layout (HOMEPAGE-001)**
   - Impact: Users cannot view homepage content
   - Evidence: [Screenshot](test-results/visual-tests-design-docume-ef467-Screenshots-Homepage-Layout-chromium/test-failed-1.png)

2. **Navigation (NAV-001)**
   - Impact: Users cannot navigate through the application
   - Evidence: [Screenshot](test-results/visual-tests-design-docume-ab244-shots-Navigation-Components-chromium/test-failed-1.png)

3. **Authentication (AUTH-001)**
   - Impact: Users cannot sign in/up
   - Evidence: [Screenshot](test-results/visual-tests-design-docume-04566-reenshots-Authentication-UI-chromium/test-failed-1.png)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Common Patterns
1. Component Mounting Issues
   - All failures occur during component mounting phase
   - Timeout errors suggest slow rendering or failed mounting

2. Resource Loading
   - Multiple components failing to load within timeout
   - Possible performance bottlenecks

3. Test Configuration
   - 60-second timeout might be insufficient
   - Possible race conditions in test setup

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement loading states for all critical components
2. Add error boundaries to handle component failures
3. Review component mounting lifecycle

### Short-term Improvements
1. Optimize component rendering performance
2. Add retry mechanisms for flaky tests
3. Implement proper error handling

### Long-term Solutions
1. Review test infrastructure
2. Implement performance monitoring
3. Add automated error reporting

## Task Tracking

Tasks are tracked in two formats:
1. [JSON Format](tasks.json) - For programmatic access
2. [CSV Format](tasks.csv) - For spreadsheet viewing

## Next Steps

1. Address critical issues (HOMEPAGE-001, NAV-001, AUTH-001)
2. Implement loading states across all components
3. Review and optimize test configuration
4. Set up monitoring for component performance
5. Implement automated error reporting

## Notes

- All timeouts set to 60 seconds
- Tests running on multiple browsers
- Most issues related to component mounting
- Consider implementing global error boundaries
