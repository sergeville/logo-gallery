## Next Actions (Prioritized)
1. Complete LogoCard advanced tests
   - Implement dark mode tests first
   - Add loading state tests
   - Complete accessibility testing

2. Fix Visual Regression Tests
   - Increase timeout to 120s
   - Update snapshot baselines
   - Fix browser-specific issues

3. Implement remaining Logo API tests
   - Complete upload endpoint tests
   - Start delete endpoint tests
   - Add error case coverage

4. Add integration tests for core flows
   - Complete auth flow tests
   - Start logo management flow tests

5. Begin performance testing setup
   - Set up performance testing environment
   - Define performance baselines
   - Create performance test scripts

## Notes
- Focus on completing component tests before moving to integration tests
- Visual regression tests need timeout adjustments (60s â†’ 120s)
- Consider parallel test execution for performance tests
- Document all fixed issues for future reference
- Regular test coverage reports needed (weekly)
- Consider adding automated performance regression testing
- Update test documentation after each major fix
