# Test Status and Tasks

## Current Status

- All tests were previously passing after fixing responsive image breakpoint tests
- Test files have been reorganized into appropriate directories
- README file created for test directories with organization guidelines and best practices
- Shared test utilities have been implemented for common testing patterns
- `LogoCard.test.tsx` updated to use shared test patterns

## Current Issues

1. **Jest Setup Configuration** (üö® Blocking)

   - [ ] Fix `expect.extend` functionality in `jest.setup.ts`
   - [ ] Error: `TypeError: expect.extend is not a function`
   - [ ] Review import order and global setup

2. **Test Environment Setup** (üö® High Priority)

   - [ ] Review Jest environment configuration
   - [ ] Verify global mocks setup
   - [ ] Check test environment initialization

3. **Jest Configuration** (‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority)

   - [ ] Audit `jest.config.js` settings
   - [ ] Verify module mappings
   - [ ] Check transform configurations

4. **Test Organization** (‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority)

   - [ ] Consolidate duplicate test files
   - [ ] Verify test directory structure
   - [ ] Update import paths after reorganization

5. **Integration Tests** (‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority)

   - [ ] Review integration test setup
   - [ ] Verify mocking configuration
   - [ ] Check test environment isolation

6. **API Tests** (‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority)

   - [ ] Review API route test setup
   - [ ] Verify Next.js API mocking
   - [ ] Check request/response handling

7. **Documentation** (üìù Low Priority)
   - [ ] Update test setup documentation
   - [ ] Document common patterns
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Completed Tasks

‚úÖ Reorganized test files into appropriate directories
‚úÖ Created README for test directories
‚úÖ Implemented shared test utilities
‚úÖ Updated `LogoCard.test.tsx` with new patterns
‚úÖ Fixed responsive image breakpoint tests

## Next Steps

1. Fix Jest setup configuration issue (blocking)
2. Review and update test environment setup
3. Audit Jest configuration
4. Continue consolidating and organizing tests
5. Document progress and update test documentation

## Progress Tracking

- Total Test Suites: 51
- Currently Failing: 51
- Main Issue: Jest setup configuration

## Notes

- Previous test organization work was successful
- Current failures are due to Jest configuration, not test logic
- Need to maintain backwards compatibility while fixing setup
