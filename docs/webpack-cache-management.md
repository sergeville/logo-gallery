# Webpack Cache Management

## Overview
This document outlines the webpack cache management solution implemented to address intermittent caching issues during development. The solution includes cache cleaning utilities, optimized webpack configuration, and npm scripts for easy maintenance.

## Problem
During development, webpack cache failures were occurring with the following symptoms:
- Error: `[webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack`
- Frequency: Intermittent
- Impact: Reduced development environment performance
- Affected Areas: Hot module reloading, build times

## Solution Components

### 1. Cache Cleaning Script
Location: `scripts/clean-cache.js`

The script provides automated cleaning of various cache directories:
```javascript
const cacheDirectories = [
  '.next/cache',        // Next.js build cache
  'node_modules/.cache' // Webpack and other build caches
];
```

Features:
- Recursive directory cleaning
- Force removal of locked files
- npm cache cleaning
- Clear feedback on cleaning progress
- Error handling for each operation

### 2. Webpack Configuration
Location: `next.config.js`

Optimized webpack configuration for better caching:
```javascript
webpack(config, { dev, isServer }) {
  if (dev && !isServer) {
    config.cache = {
      type: 'filesystem',
      version: require('./package-lock.json').lockfileVersion.toString(),
      buildDependencies: {
        config: [__filename],
      },
      cacheDirectory: '.next/cache/webpack',
      name: dev ? 'development' : 'production',
      compression: 'gzip',
    };
  }
}
```

Key improvements:
- Filesystem-based caching
- Dependency-aware cache versioning
- Separate development/production caches
- Gzip compression for cache files
- Deterministic module IDs

### 3. NPM Scripts
Location: `package.json`

Added convenience scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean-cache": "node scripts/clean-cache.js",
    "dev:clean": "npm run clean-cache && npm run dev"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Regular Development
Continue using the standard development command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### When Experiencing Cache Issues
Clean all caches and start fresh:
```bash
npm run clean-cache
```

### Start Development with Clean Cache
Use this command to ensure a fresh start:
```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   ```bash
   Error: EACCES: permission denied
   ```
   Solution: Run the clean command with elevated privileges or fix directory permissions.

2. **Cache Lock Files**
   ```bash
   Error: EBUSY: resource busy or locked
   ```
   Solution: Close all Node.js processes and try again.

3. **Disk Space Issues**
   ```bash
   Error: ENOSPC: no space left on device
   ```
   Solution: Free up disk space or clean other caches manually.

### Prevention

1. Regular Maintenance:
   - Run `npm run clean-cache` periodically
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor disk space

2. Development Best Practices:
   - Use `dev:clean` after major dependency updates
   - Keep the number of open files within system limits
   - Avoid running multiple dev servers simultaneously

## Performance Impact

The implemented solution provides:
- Reduced build times
- More reliable hot module reloading
- Smaller disk space usage
- Better dependency tracking

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. Automated cache cleanup on dependency changes
2. Cache size monitoring and alerts
3. Selective cache cleaning options
4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines
